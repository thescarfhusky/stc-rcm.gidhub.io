                    <h2><p>Welcome to Seedling Theatre Company! We are a performing arts studio servicing the Henderson, Southern Las Vegas and Boulder City areas. We offer a variety of courses for kids ages 4 to 18 years. Our studio has a fully equipped theatre (stage, lighting, sound) as well as additional rooms for dance and vocal performance classes.

                    <h3><p>Seedling Theatre Company is dedicated to providing 
an environment where children and teens feel welcome, encouraged, 
and empowered through participating in the performing
 arts and where instructors teach with patience and love, 
striving to develop the potential in every student.</p></h3>

<br><br>


<h2><p>Everyone loves the excitement and energy of performance days,
 and our staff is no exception. But what about all
 the hours and hours of class time and rehearsals?
We believe that every student, in every class, of every day we are open should be 
learning something new. Whether it’s choreography for an opening musical
 number or the historical background of a dramatic play, this philosophy
 pushes us, as teachers, to make the most of our instruction time. 
There is no limit to the knowledge,the experiences, the skills and the inspiration 
    that can come from the theatre.</p></h2>

    <h3><p>At Seedling Theatre Company we feel very strongly that students, teachers, parents, and even audience members, should feel comfortable in our classrooms and at our performances. We make every effort to keep our performance content, costumes, music, choreography, and the language we use in and out of the classroom “family friendly”. All students are asked to abide by a code of conduct that encourages a positive environment and respect for others.
Throughout the year we will have many opportunities for families to get involved in special performances and events. Volunteers are welcome to help in many ways. We also look for opportunities to provide theatre involvement for special populations.
We are committed to reserving one day a week for families and will not be open for classes or performances on Sundays.</p></h3>

<h2><p>Growing partnerships with local schools and other theatre organizations has helped us broaden the opportunities we can offer our students. We firmly believe that supporting the performing arts, wherever they are offered, is a responsibility we all need to share. We are so proud of our students, past and present, for the contributions they are making to their schools and community organizations through theatre, choir, orchestra, dance, and student government. The skills our kids are learning and building upon at Seedling have produced some phenomenal teachers--some of who are instructors with us currently.
